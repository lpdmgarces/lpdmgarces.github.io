Len Patrick Garces is a **Lecturer** at the [University of Technology Sydney, School of Mathematical and Physical Sciences](https://www.uts.edu.au/about/faculty-science/school-mathematical-and-physical-sciences) and the **Program Director** of the Postgraduate Quantitative Finance courses offered by the university: 
  - [Master of Quantitative Finance](https://www.uts.edu.au/study/find-a-course/master-quantitative-finance)
  - [Master of Data Science in Quantitative Finance](https://www.uts.edu.au/study/find-a-course/master-data-science-quantitative-finance)
  - [Master of Mathematics and Quantitative Finance](https://www.uts.edu.au/study/find-a-course/master-mathematics-and-quantitative-finance)
He also teaches several subjects for the Quantitative Finance courses at UTS.

He is also an Associate Investigator at the [ARC Centre of Excellence in Population Ageing Research (CEPAR)](https://cepar.edu.au/).

Broadly, his research interests lie within the field of **financial and actuarial mathematics**, primarily on the applications of probability theory and stochastic analysis to tackle financial and actuarial problems (e.g. financial or insurance risk modelling and management, asset price modelling, term structure modelling, pricing and hedging financial derivatives) and the development of numerical and statistical methods to solve these problems.

His current research is on continuous-time stochastic mortality models and their applications to actuarial valuation, the design and valuation of retirement income products, robust consumption and investment problems, and indifference pricing of mortality-linked securities.
